## winnux

##### Make Linux Mint or Ubuntu (cinnamon) look like Windows 10 using one terminal script.

May work with Debian. I'm not sure.

**PLEASE** do not make any silly issue reports. Only Zero-day vulnerabilities can go there unless I file a report.

* I took out the download links so I could debug the code and upload a new version
