Linux | Version
------------ | -------------
Arch Linux | [1.0alpha](https://github.com/techguy16/winnux/releases/download/arch-1.0alpha/WinnuxArch.sh)
Manjaro | [1.0alpha](https://github.com/techguy16/winnux/releases/download/arch-1.0alpha/WinnuxArch.sh)

When downloaded, open Terminal and navigate to the directory you downloaded the file to. Most of the time it will be as easy as  ```cd Downloads```. 
After that, type ```sh Winnux.sh``` (Arch/Manjaro Users - type ```sh WinnuxArch.sh```). You might have to type your password. After that, sit back and relax while my script does the work for you!
