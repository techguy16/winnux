# Winnux

There is no better way to make your Linux Computer look like Windows than Winnux!

### Table of versions
Download the correct one for your computer:

Linux | Version
------------ | -------------
Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial - Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy" LTS | [1.0](https://github.com/techguy16/winnux/releases/download/1.0/Winnux_1-0.sh)
Mint 18 "Sarah" - Mint 20.3 "Una" | [1.0](https://github.com/techguy16/winnux/releases/download/1.0/Winnux_1-0.sh)

When downloaded, open Terminal and navigate to the directory you downloaded the file to. Most of the time it will be as easy as  ```cd Downloads```. 

After that, type ```sh Winnux_1-0.sh```. You might have to type your password. After that, sit back and relax while my script does the work for you!
