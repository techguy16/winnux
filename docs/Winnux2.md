### What is Winnux 2.0?
Winnux 2.0 is the next version of the Winnux Project, an attempt at making the Cinnamon Desktop look like Windows 10 or 11.

### Why Winnux 2.0? Isn't Winnux 1.x good enough?
Winnux 2.0 adds many features that just don't look or feel right in the older Winnux 1.x series. 

### When did you decide to make Winnux 2.0?
I started to get annoyed with the state of the original script, because it was so messy and there were no comments, so I started adding comments and new features (because I now knew where things where.)
